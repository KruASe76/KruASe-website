        <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm KruASe, a hobbyist in programming, but, I think, it will be my profession. I mainly use Python3 and
          I am a back-end programmer, but recently I have started learning web and have found it quite exciting!<br>
          That's why I have created this website.

        <h2>What is on this website?</h2>
        <p>
          Well, I will regularly update it by adding new pages. The site is a useless thing masquerading as
          my portfolio of small web apps.

          <h3><a href="cipher/">KruASe Cipher</a></h3>
          <p>
            One time I was keenly interested in encoding/decoding to/from binary/hex. So much as I decided to make
            my own cipher. But it's rather a multy-stage encrypting algorythm than a cipher... Anyway, check it!

          <h3><a href="schedule/">My class schedule</a> <span class="accent">[RU]</span></h3>
          <p>
            The schedule of my class that changes too often brang to my mind to make a shedule that will be accessible
            from everywhere and up to date almost always in one place. So, I made this. The schedule that is easy to
            change because of dynamic filling with names of subjects that depends on table cells classes. On Wednesday
            my class is divided into two groups, and each of them has its own schedule. So, I added a button that
            swithes the group and edits the schedule, and selected status is saved and keeps even after browser closing.

          <h3>Moving website to Django (Python3)</h3>
          <p>
            The next big update for my site will be moving it to another platform - Python3 framework Django.
            Firstly this site was created using common HTML5 - CSS - JS template, but now I want to gain experience
            making website with Django. But the higher priority plan is to finish CodenamesBot
