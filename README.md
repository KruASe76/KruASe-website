# Cipher_Website

A website with common HTML5 - CSS - JavaScript build template

### You can encrypt and decrupt text using **my own cipher**!

Uses not a very simple algorithm.  
Functions are imported to `cipher.js` from another obfuscated file `KruASeCoder.js`.

*I really hope that nobody will analyse that terrible obfuscated text*
